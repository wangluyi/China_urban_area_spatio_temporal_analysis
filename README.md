# China_urban_area_spatio_temporal_analysis

Using the urban area raster data in year [1995,2000,2005,2008,2010,2013] in China to analyze the spatial temporal pattern of urban development.

With ArcGIS and these arcpy code, we can calculate the urban development trend in 8 equal-angle (45Â°) directions of 205 prefecture-level cities in China. The center of each city is derived from the night time light remote sensing image.
